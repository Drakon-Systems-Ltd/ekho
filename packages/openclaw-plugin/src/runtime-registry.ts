/**
 * One heartbeat/auto-reply producer per agent per process, across module copies.
 *
 * Every timer this plugin starts lives in module state (connection.ts). A host
 * hot reload (`openclaw plugins reload|update`) evaluates a FRESH copy of the
 * bundle from a new install generation in the same process, so the old copy's
 * timers keep running unless something stops them: each reload added another
 * heartbeat producer (with its own, stale turn-health window) and another
 * inbox poller. The host's stop signal (see index.ts) is the first line of
 * defence; this registry is the second, for hosts that never send one.
 *
 * It lives on globalThis under a registered symbol, so every copy of the
 * bundle in the process sees the same map. Each module copy takes a
 * generation number from it at load, so "newer" is a total order even when two
 * copies connect out of order: the newest generation always wins, and an older
 * one that finishes connecting late stands down instead of stopping the new one.
